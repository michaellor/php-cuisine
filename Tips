Starting up mySQL at epicodus:

mysql.server start followed by the command mysql -uroot -proot.

Staring up mySQL at home:

If you're working with MAMP at home, once you've started the servers, you can access your MySQL terminal by entering /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql --host=localhost -uroot -proot.

Use localhost:8889 if you're using MAMP


Now use your browser to open localhost:8080/phpmyadmin if you're at Epicodus, or localhost:8888/phpmyadmin if you're at home using MAMP.
